# Rust on ESP with STD "Hello, World" app

A small demo app demonstrating calling into STD code (threads, console and TCP/IP).

For more information, check the [STD-enabled Rust compiler port for ESP](https://github.com/ivmarkov/rust).

## Background

The app is a simple "Hello, World" web server implememented with Rust's [Rocket web framework](https://rocket.rs/).

## Building

* The app currently uses PlatformIO as a driver for building the ESP-IDF framework, for linking with the Rust code and for flashing etc.
* The Rust code is compiled to a static C library, which is then linked against the PlatformIO code to get the final elf & bin executables
* Since as per above PlatformIO is only used to build the ESP-IDF framework itself, it might be removed as a requirement in future (even though integration with PlatformIO brings other benefits, like eaiser support for multi-language (C & Rust) projects)
* Since the work to integrate the Rust build system with PlatformIO's own build is unfinished, you'll have to first build the Rust side (using the regular `cargo build --release`) and then trigger the PlatformIO build separately.

### Rough steps

* Clone and build the [Xtensa Rust compiler](https://github.com/ivmarkov/rust) first and make sure it is linked as a custom toolchain in Rustup and activated, as per the instructions there. Make sure you've installed Xargo too.
* Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/ivmarkov/rust-esp32-std-hello`
* `cd rust-esp32-std-hello/rust`
* `xargo build --release`
* NOTE: Currently building with cargo its build-std support (e.g. `cargo build --release`) does not work.
* `cd ..`
* Apply a small fix to the ESP-IDF TLS pthread support (to be submitted as an issue against the ESP-IDF repo):
```
cd ~/.platformio/packages/framework-espidf
git apply ~/...(this path is specific to your env).../rust-esp32-std-hello/pthread_destructor_fix.diff
cd ~/...(this path is specific to your env).../rust-esp32-std-hello
```
* Change lines 137 and 138 in `rust-esp32-std-hello/rust/src/lib.rs` to contain the SSID & password of your wireless network
* Invoke the PlatformIO build in the app home directory
* Flash

NOTE 1: The debug build is currently VERY large (to be investigated), hence why the steps above produce a release build above

NOTE 2: Even with release build, the final executable will be ~ 1.5MB (where 600-700K are because Rocket is relatively heavy; the other fatness comes from the ESP-IDF WiFi driver itself) which is above the standard app partition size of most ESP boards. Hence **this project has a custom partition**

## Running

* Once you flash and run the app, connect to the board UART0 port, e.g. `miniterm /dev/ttyUSB0 115200` or similar
* You should see more or less the following:

```

* NOTE: If you have not applied the pthread patch correctly, the app will CRASH just after the line which says "About to join the threads. If ESP-IDF was patched successfully, joining will NOT crash".
* If the app starts successfully, it should be listening on the printed IP address.
* Open a browser, and navigate to `http://<printed-ip-address>:8000/`
